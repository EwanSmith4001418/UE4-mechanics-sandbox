Ideas to implement into Unreal Engine 4:
Continuous Elevator(done)- with button activation (not done)

Dishonoured Style teleport (done)

Character-controller - with wall-sticking and climbing

Breakable Wall - broken with laser beams fired/melee attacks by player

Door - that uses key

Platforming level with enemies below that chase and kill you if you fall

Health bar

Melee Attacks

Chargeable and fireable lazer beams
